Subashtion is a cli tool that allows you to subscribe to youtubers without a google account.

## commands

To add a new youtube account type `sb add *username* *userid*` to get the userid
go to [vid.puffyan.us](https://vid.puffyan.us) and search the person you want
to subscibe to.

To remove a youtube account type `sb remove *username*`.

You can use the `sb list` command to list all the accounts you subscribed to.

If you want to check if someone uploaded a new video just type `sb` without any
command.

You can also use the `sb check *username*` command to only check if one person 
uploaded a new video.

Currently you have to create the subsciptions.txt file manually but im working
on a install script.
